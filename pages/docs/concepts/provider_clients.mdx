# Model provider clients in Rig

A provider client (or a model provider client) is an entity represented as a struct that can create clients for different types of LLMs or models, depending on the features supported by a given model provider.

Since the introduction of `rig::client::DynClientBuilder` (`rig` v0.13), clients now must implement the `rig::client::ProviderClient` trait. The trait signature can be found below:

```rust
pub trait ProviderClient:
    AsCompletion + AsTranscription + AsEmbeddings + AsImageGeneration + AsAudioGeneration + Debug
{
    /// Create a client from the process's environment.
    /// Panics if an environment is improperly configured.
    fn from_env() -> Self
    where
        Self: Sized;

    // .. there are other methods here, but as they already have a default implementation
    // for the most part we don't need to concern ourselves with them
}
```

`ProviderClient` currently requires the following traits:

- `Debug`
- `AsCompletion` (the trait for creating a completion model client; additionally offers methods for agents and JSON extractors)
- `AsTranscription` (the trait for creating a transcription model client)
- `AsEmbedding` (the trait for creating a embedding model client)
- `AsImageGeneration` (the trait for creating an image generation model client)
- `AsAudioGeneration` (the trait for creating an audio generation model client)

Each of the above traits (besides `Debug` which is a standard trait) is relatively easy to implement.

While this trait is slightly confusing, your provider does not have to actually have to support everything listed. Fortunately, there is a macro called `impl_conversion_traits` which allows us to auto-implement whichever traits a given provider doesn't support by simply returning None.

An example of this can be found below:

```rust
// note: when adding a model to the rig-core codebase, `rig` should be `crate`
rig::impl_conversion_traits!(
    AsEmbeddings,
    AsTranscription,
    AsImageGeneration,
    AsAudioGeneration for Client
);
```

Because this returns None, if you attempt to create an embedding model client (for example) from this particular Client using `rig::client::DynClientBuilder`, it will simply return None rather than a model.

## How to write your client implementation

To implement a given trait, you simply need to implement the corresponding client trait. For example - the trait for `AsCompletion` is `rig::client::completion::CompletionClient`. Because `AsCompletion` is already implemented for `T: Clone` (meaning every single type), as long as you're able to derive Clone for your client, `AsCompletion` will automatically be implemented - which automatically satisfies the relevant requirement for `ProviderClient`. This is the same across all the other traits.

As Rig is currently an unstable crate (SemVer dictates that non-stable crates must stay at v0.x), this page may be updated in accordance with the state of the crate.

## Using the dynamic client builder

If you're running a multi-agent service, you may find yourself needing to pull from more than one provider at any given time. For this type of use case, the `rig::client::DynClientBuilder` may prove very useful.
