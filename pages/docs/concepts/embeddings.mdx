# Embeddings in Rig

Rig provides a comprehensive embeddings system for converting text and other data types into numerical vector representations that can be used for semantic search, similarity comparisons, and other NLP tasks.

## Core Concepts

### Embeddings

An embedding is a vector representation of data (usually text) where semantically similar items are mapped to nearby points in the vector space. In Rig, embeddings are represented by the `Embedding` struct which contains:

- The original document text
- The vector representation as `Vec<f64>`

### The Embedding Process

In order for a type (or piece of data) to be considered a valid embeddable document, it needs to implement the `Embed` trait. While you can write the `impl Embed` type manually, we also have a derive macro to help you implement this quickly and without hassle (note that the `Embed` derive macro requires the `derive` feature of `rig-core` to be enabled).

The following type is a valid `Embed` type:

```rust
#[derive(Embed)]
struct Foo {
    id: i32,
    #[embed]
    name: String
}
```

The following type is also a valid Embed type:

```rust
struct Foo {
    id: i32,
    name: String
}

impl Embed for WordDefinition {
    fn embed(&self, embedder: &mut TextEmbedder) -> Result<(), EmbedError> {
       // Embeddings only need to be generated for `definition` field.
       // Split the definitions by comma and collect them into a vector of strings.
       // That way, different embeddings can be generated for each definition in the `definitions` string.
       embedder.embed(self.name.to_owned());

       Ok(())
    }
}
```

To use this in a workflow, it is ideal to use the `EmbeddingsBuilder` struct to be able to process multiple documents at once:

```rust
// required trait import for embedding_model fn to exist
use rig::client::embeddings::EmbeddingsClient;
let documents = vec![
    Foo {
        id: 1,
        name: "Rig".to_string()
    },
    Foo {
        id: 2,
        name: "Playgrounds".to_string()
    }
];

let model = rig::providers::openai::Client::from_env().embedding_model("text-embedding-ada-002");

let embeddings = EmbeddingsBuilder::new(model)
    .documents(documents)?
    .build()
    .await?;
```

The returned `embeddings` type signature will now be an iterator over `(T, OneOrMany<Embedding>)` where T implements Embed. You can either collect these into a vector and use it elsewhere, or dump it directly into a vector store:

```rust
use rig::vector_store::InsertDocuments;
// note: this function is pseudo-code
// look into specific crate integrations for more indepth
// usage explanations
let qdrant = create_qdrant_vector_store();

qdrant.insert_documents(embeddings).await?;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Document Preparation**
   - Clean and normalize text before embedding
   - Consider chunking large documents
   - Remove irrelevant embedding content

2. **Error Handling**
   - Handle provider API errors gracefully
   - Validate vector dimensions
   - Check for empty or invalid input

3. **Batching**
   - Use `EmbeddingsBuilder` for multiple documents
   - Respects provider's max batch size
   - Automatically handles concurrent processing
