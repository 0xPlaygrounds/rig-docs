# Rig Tools

Tools are a core concept in Rig that allow agents to perform specific actions or computations. They provide a structured way to extend an agent's capabilities beyond pure language model interactions.

## Overview

Tools in Rig are implemented through two main traits:

- `Tool`: The base trait for implementing simple tools
- `ToolEmbedding`: An extension trait that allows tools to be stored in vector stores and used with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

## Basic Tool Implementation

A basic tool requires implementing the `Tool` trait, which defines:

1. A unique name identifier
2. Input argument types
3. Output types
4. Error handling
5. Tool definition (description and parameters)
6. Execution logic

Here's a simple example of a tool that adds two numbers:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct AddArgs {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Adder;

impl Tool for Adder {
    const NAME: &'static str = "add";
    type Error = MathError;
    type Args = AddArgs;
    type Output = i32;

    async fn definition(&self, _prompt: String) -> ToolDefinition {
        ToolDefinition {
            name: "add".to_string(),
            description: "Add x and y together".to_string(),
            parameters: json!({
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "x": { "type": "number", "description": "First number" },
                    "y": { "type": "number", "description": "Second number" }
                }
            })
        }
    }

    async fn call(&self, args: Self::Args) -> Result<Self::Output, Self::Error> {
        Ok(args.x + args.y)
    }
}
```

## RAG-Enabled Tools

Tools can be made RAG-enabled by implementing the `ToolEmbedding` trait, which allows them to be:

1. Stored in vector stores
2. Retrieved based on semantic similarity
3. Dynamically added to agent prompts

Reference implementation:

```rust filename="rig-core/examples/rag_dynamic_tools.rs [28:77]"
struct Add;

impl Tool for Add {
    const NAME: &'static str = "add";

    type Error = MathError;
    type Args = OperationArgs;
    type Output = i32;

    async fn definition(&self, _prompt: String) -> ToolDefinition {
        serde_json::from_value(json!({
            "name": "add",
            "description": "Add x and y together",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "x": {
                        "type": "number",
                        "description": "The first number to add"
                    },
                    "y": {
                        "type": "number",
                        "description": "The second number to add"
                    }
                }
            }
        }))
        .expect("Tool Definition")
    }

    async fn call(&self, args: Self::Args) -> Result<Self::Output, Self::Error> {
        let result = args.x + args.y;
        Ok(result)
    }
}

impl ToolEmbedding for Add {
    type InitError = InitError;
    type Context = ();
    type State = ();

    fn init(_state: Self::State, _context: Self::Context) -> Result<Self, Self::InitError> {
        Ok(Add)
    }

    fn embedding_docs(&self) -> Vec<String> {
        vec!["Add x and y together".into()]
    }

    fn context(&self) -> Self::Context {}
```

## Deriving JSON schemas with macros

While implementing your own tools, you may find that using the raw `serde_json::json!` macro can be a bit clumsy and error prone.

Fortunately, the `schemars` crate has a great way to solve this: with a derive macro (and helpers)! By deriving the `schemars::JsonSchema` macro, we can use description helpers to write our JSON schema instead of having to write it all manually.

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize, schemars::JsonSchema)]
struct OperationArgs {
    #[schemars(description = "The first number to add.")]
    x: i32,
    #[schemars(description = "The first number to add.")]
    y: i32,
}
```

Once you're ready to implement your tool, now rather than having to write it all out manually you can turn your schema into a `serde_json::Value` and slot it into your tool definition:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Adder;

impl Tool for Adder {
    // .. other trait impl parts here
    async fn definition(&self, _prompt: String) -> ToolDefinition {
        // this should technically never error out as it's generated from set codegen
        let parameters = serde_json::to_value(schema_for!(OperationArgs)).unwrap();

        ToolDefinition {
            name: "add".to_string(),
            description: "Add x and y together".to_string(),
            parameters,
        }
    }
    // .. other trait impl parts here
}
```

Rig currently uses `schemars` v0.8.16. If you're encountering strange errors, you may want to double check the version of your `schemars` crate.

### Tool Macros

Often times if you just want to create simple tools and don't need any special particular implementation details, writing out the entire `impl Tool` block can be quite cumbersome.

Fortunately, the `rig_derive` crate has a helpful derive macro called `tool_macro` which you can use to create your own tools easily. See below for an example of usage:

```rust
use rig_derive::tool_macro;

// note that OpenAI Responses API, the currently default OpenAI integration for `rig`, requires all inputs to be required
#[rig_tool(
    description = "Perform basic arithmetic operations",
    required(x, y, operation)
)]
fn calculator(x: i32, y: i32, operation: String) -> Result<i32, rig::tool::ToolError> {
    match operation.as_str() {
        "add" => Ok(x + y),
        "subtract" => Ok(x - y),
        "multiply" => Ok(x * y),
        "divide" => {
            if y == 0 {
                Err(rig::tool::ToolError::ToolCallError(
                    "Division by zero".into(),
                ))
            } else {
                Ok(x / y)
            }
        }
        _ => Err(rig::tool::ToolError::ToolCallError(
            format!("Unknown operation: {operation}").into(),
        )),
    }
}
```

## Tool Servers
Traditionally, storing tools in a struct to be retrieved at will in an async context often requires the use of access patterns like `Arc<RwLock<T>>` and `Arc<Mutex<T>>`. This can potentially slow down performance from having to lock multiple times, as well as cause deadlocks.

One way that we've solved in `0.22.0` and beyond is to separately run what we call "tool servers" - essentially Tokio spawned tasks that use message passing and await for messages, processes the messages and sends a message back to the tool server handle (which can be held by the Agent and used internally by it for multi-turn prompting). As long as there is at least one copy of the server handle, the server loop will run.

To create a tool server, all you need to do is the following:

```rust
use rig::tool::server::{ToolServer, ToolServerHandle};

let tool_server: ToolServerHandle = ToolServer::new()
    .tool(Adder) // add a tool
    .run();
```

Like Agents, tool servers accept static tools, dynamic tools and MCP tools (via `rmcp`). When building an Agent, you can also give it a clone of a tool server handle and it will use that server - letting you share a set of tools between multiple agents.

## Using Tools with Agents

Tools can be added to agents in two ways:

1. Static Tools: Always available to the agent

```rust
let agent = client
    .agent("gpt-4")
    .preamble("You are a calculator.")
    .tool(Adder)
    .tool(Subtract)
    .build();
```

2. Dynamic Tools: Retrieved from a vector store based on the query

```rust
let agent = client
    .agent("gpt-4")
    .preamble("You are a calculator.")
    .dynamic_tools(2, vector_store_index, toolset)
    .build();
```

## Tool Organization

Tools are typically organized in a `ToolSet`, which provides:

- Tool registration and management
- Tool lookup by name
- Tool execution routing
- Conversion to embeddings for RAG

## Best Practices

1. **Unique Names**: Ensure each tool has a unique name within your application
2. **Clear Descriptions**: Provide clear, detailed descriptions in tool definitions
3. **Type Safety**: Use strong typing for tool arguments and outputs
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error types and handling
5. **RAG Consideration**: Consider implementing `ToolEmbedding` if your tool might benefit from semantic retrieval

## Integration with LLMs

Tools are automatically integrated with LLM providers through Rig's agent system. The library handles:

- Converting tool definitions to provider-specific formats
- Parsing LLM outputs into tool calls
- Routing tool calls to appropriate implementations
- Returning tool results to the LLM

For more information on integrating tools with specific LLM providers, see the provider-specific documentation in the [`providers`](../integrations/model_providers.mdx) module.
