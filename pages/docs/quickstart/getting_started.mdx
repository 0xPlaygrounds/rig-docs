## Pre-requisites

Before installing `rig`, make sure you have [the Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

## Installing Rig

To install `rig`, you can do so with the following command in a Rust project (in your terminal):

```bash
cargo add rig-core tokio
```

This will add the `rig-core` dependency in your Rust project, as well as Tokio which is an asynchronous Rust runtime which you will need to use `rig`.

## Basic Usage

Below is a simple example of how you can use `rig` to prompt OpenAI's GPT-4 model:

```rust
use rig::client::{CompletionClient, ProviderClient};
use rig::completion::Prompt;
use rig::providers::openai;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
    // Create OpenAI client
    let client = openai::Client::from_env();

    // Create agent with a single context prompt
    let comedian_agent = client
        .agent("gpt-5.2")
        .preamble("You are a comedian here to entertain the user using humour and jokes.")
        .build();

    // Prompt the agent and print the response
    let response = comedian_agent.prompt("Entertain me!").await?;

    println!("{response}");

    Ok(())
}
```

To run this, you will need an OpenAI API key as an environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`). Then simply use `cargo run` and you'll see your response!
