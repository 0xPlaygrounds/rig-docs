## Pre-requisites

Before installing `rig`, make sure you have [the Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

## Installing Rig

To install `rig`, you can do so with the following command in a Rust project (in your terminal):

```bash
cargo add rig-core tokio
```

This will add the `rig-core` dependency in your Rust project, as well as Tokio which is an asynchronous Rust runtime which you will need to use `rig`.

## Basic Usage

Below is a simple example of how you can use `rig` to prompt OpenAI's GPT-4 model:

```rust
use rig::{completion::Prompt, providers::openai};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create OpenAI client and model
    // This requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.
    let openai_client = openai::Client::from_env();

    let gpt4 = openai_client.agent("gpt-4").build();

    // Prompt the model and print its response
    let response = gpt4
        .prompt("Who are you?")
        .await
        .expect("Failed to prompt GPT-4");

    println!("GPT-4: {response}");
}
```

To run this, you will need an OpenAI API key as an environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`). Then simply use `cargo run` and you'll see your response!
