## Core concepts

### Completion and embedding models

Rig provides a consistent API for working with LLMs and embeddings. Specifically,
each provider (e.g. OpenAI, Cohere) has a `Client` struct that can be used to initialize completion
and embedding models. These models implement the [CompletionModel](crate::completion::CompletionModel)
and [EmbeddingModel](crate::embeddings::EmbeddingModel) traits respectively, which provide a common,
low-level interface for creating completion and embedding requests and executing them.

### Agents

Rig also provides high-level abstractions over LLMs in the form of the [Agent](crate::agent::Agent) type.

The [Agent](crate::agent::Agent) type can be used to create anything from simple agents that use vanilla models to full blown
RAG systems that can be used to answer questions using a knowledge base.

### Vector stores and indexes

Rig defines a common interface for working with vector stores and indexes. Specifically, the library
provides the [VectorStore](crate::vector_store::VectorStore) and [VectorStoreIndex](crate::vector_store::VectorStoreIndex)
traits, which can be implemented on a given type to define vector stores and indices respectively.
Those can then be used as the knowledge base for a RAG enabled [Agent](crate::agent::Agent), or
as a source of context documents in a custom architecture that use multiple LLMs or agents.
