## Pre-requisites
Before installing `rig`, make sure you have the Rust programming language installed! [Install Rust here.](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Installing rig
To install rig, you can do so with the following command in a Rust project (in your terminal):

```bash
cargo add rig-core tokio
```

This will add the `rig-core` dependency in your Rust project, as well as Tokio which is an asynchronous Rust runtime which you will need to use `rig`.

## Using Rig

### Basic usage
Below is a simple example of how you can use Rig to prompt OpenAI's GPT-4 model:

```rust
use rig::{completion::Prompt, providers::openai};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create OpenAI client and model
    // This requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.
    let openai_client = openai::Client::from_env();

    let gpt4 = openai_client.agent("gpt-4").build();

    // Prompt the model and print its response
    let response = gpt4
        .prompt("Who are you?")
        .await
        .expect("Failed to prompt GPT-4");

    println!("GPT-4: {response}");
}
```

To run this, you will need an OpenAI API key as an environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`). Then simply use `cargo run` and you'll see your response!

### Embeddings
Embeddings are pieces of data or information stored as float arrays. They are an essential part of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows, where semantic search is used to find semantically similar texts and return payloads associated with them. These payloads are then used as part of prompts.

Below is an example of how you can use `rig` to embed some simple documents.

```rust
use rig::{embeddings::EmbeddingsBuilder, providers::openai};

// Create OpenAI client and model
// This requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.
let openai_client = openai::Client::from_env();

// Create embedding model
let model = openai_client.embedding_model("text-embedding-ada-002");

// Build embeddings
let embeddings = EmbeddingsBuilder::new(model)
    .document("Some text")?
    .document("More text")?
    .build()
    .await?;
```

This code snippet will return an array of embeddings, assuming the OpenAI API is called successfully.

### Tool functions
For inference APIs that support tools and function calling, we also additionally support tool calling.

You can also create your own custom tools. Below is an example of how to create your own tool:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct AddArgs {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Adder;

impl Tool for Adder {
    const NAME: &'static str = "add";
    type Error = MathError;
    type Args = AddArgs;
    type Output = i32;

    async fn definition(&self, _prompt: String) -> ToolDefinition {
        ToolDefinition {
            name: "add".to_string(),
            description: "Add x and y together".to_string(),
            parameters: json!({
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "x": { "type": "number", "description": "First number" },
                    "y": { "type": "number", "description": "Second number" }
                }
            })
        }
    }

    async fn call(&self, args: Self::Args) -> Result<Self::Output, Self::Error> {
        Ok(args.x + args.y)
    }
}
```

Then you can call it with your agent during the builder method like so:

```rust
// Create agent with a single context prompt and two tools
let calculator_agent = openai_client
    .agent(providers::openai::GPT_4O)
    .preamble("You are a calculator here to help the user perform arithmetic operations. Use the tools provided to answer the user's question.")
    .max_tokens(1024)
    .tool(Adder)
    .build();
```
