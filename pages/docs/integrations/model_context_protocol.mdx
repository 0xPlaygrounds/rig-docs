# Using Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Rig

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** by Anthropic provides a standardized way for AI agents to dynamically discover, register, and invoke external tools through a common interface. This enables tools to be treated as first-class citizens in LLM-based workflows and allows for seamless integration between agents and external capabilities.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol that enables language models and agents to:

- Discover available tools from a remote server.
- Initialize and declare their capabilities.
- Invoke registered tools and receive responses.

It defines both **client** and **server** roles. The **server** hosts tools and responds to invocations, while the **client** discovers and uses those tools.

## Creating an MCP client

Creating an MCP client requires the `mcp-core` crate to be installed. You can run the following one-line command below in your terminal to install it quickly:

```bash
cargo add mcp-core
```

You will also additionally need the `mcp` feature enabled on the `rig-core` crate. If you haven't done so already, you can run the following one-line command in your terminal to add it to your project:

```bash
cargo add rig-core -F mcp
```

### Initialising an MCP client

To connect to the server and fetch tool metadata, you need to create a client using the `mcp-core` crate.

```rust
use mcp_core::{ClientSseTransportBuilder, ClientBuilder};

let mcp_client = ClientBuilder::new(
    ClientSseTransportBuilder::new("http://127.0.0.1:3000/sse".to_string()).build(),
)
.build();

mcp_client.open().await?;

let init_res = mcp_client
    .initialize(
        Implementation {
            name: "mcp-client".to_string(),
            version: "0.1.0".to_string(),
        },
        ClientCapabilities::default(),
    )
    .await?;
println!("Initialized: {:?}", init_res);
```

Note that you **must** initialise the client by using `mcp_client.initialize()`, otherwise this can result in connection errors!

### Listing MCP tools

Once initialized, the client can list tools available on the MCP server:

```rust
let tools_list_res = mcp_client.list_tools(None, None).await?;
println!("Tools: {:?}", tools_list_res);
```

### Using MCP tools

Now that you've retrieved the tool list from the MCP server, you can now pass it into a Rig agent:

```rust
let completion_model = providers::openai::Client::from_env();
let mut agent_builder = completion_model.agent("gpt-4o");

agent_builder = tools_list_res
    .tools
    .into_iter()
    .fold(agent_builder, |builder, tool| {
        builder.mcp_tool(tool, mcp_client.clone().into())
    });

let agent = agent_builder.build();

let response = agent.prompt("Add 10 + 10").await?;
tracing::info!("Agent response: {:?}", response);
```

### Troubleshooting

If you are having issues with the `mcp_core::tool` macro expansion, you may need to ensure your `schemars` version is at `0.8.22`.
