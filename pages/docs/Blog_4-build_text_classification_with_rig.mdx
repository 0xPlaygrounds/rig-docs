# Building a Text Classification and Extraction System with Rig: A Comprehensive Guide

Text classification and extraction are essential for AI systems to interpret and utilize unstructured text data, with applications ranging from sentiment analysis in social media to named entity recognition in legal documents. This guide demonstrates how to build a robust text classification and extraction system using Rig, a powerful Rust library for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). By the end of this guide, you will know how to use Rig to implement an efficient, secure, and maintainable LLM application in Rust, complete with practical examples and best practices. Let's lock in!


## Introduction

Text classification and extraction enable machines to understand and derive meaningful insights from unstructured text data. Text classification involves categorizing text documents into predefined classes, while information extraction focuses on identifying and extracting specific pieces of information from text.

These techniques are increasingly important in our data-driven world, finding applications in various domains such as:

- Customer feedback analysis
- Content moderation
- Resume parsing
- Medical record processing
- Financial news analysis

While traditional machine learning approaches have long been used for these tasks, the advent of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** has dramatically improved their accuracy and flexibility. However, working with LLMs can be complex, requiring careful management of API calls, prompt engineering, and result parsing.

This is where **Rig** comes in. Rig is a Rust library that simplifies the process of building LLM-powered applications, providing a clean and efficient API for working with models like GPT-3 and GPT-4. By leveraging Rig, we can build a text classification and extraction system that is powerful, accurate, type-safe, performant, and easy to maintain.

## Understanding Text Classification and Extraction

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand what text classification and extraction entail and why they're so valuable.

### Text Classification

Text classification is the task of assigning predefined categories to text documents based on their content. It's a supervised learning problem where an algorithm learns to identify which category a piece of text belongs to, based on labeled training data.

Common examples include:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining whether a piece of text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
2. **Topic Categorization**: Assigning topics or themes to documents, such as categorizing news articles into sports, politics, technology, etc.
3. **Language Detection**: Identifying the language in which a text is written.
4. **Spam Detection**: Classifying emails or messages as spam or not spam.

### Information Extraction

Information extraction involves identifying and extracting structured information from unstructured text. It's about pulling out specific pieces of data that conform to a predefined structure or pattern.

Common tasks include:

1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., person names, organizations, locations) in text.
2. **Relation Extraction**: Identifying relationships between entities in text.
3. **Event Extraction**: Extracting information about events described in text, including participants, time, and location.
4. **Key-Value Pair Extraction**: Extracting specific attributes and their values from text.

The power of text classification and extraction lies in automating the process of deriving structured, actionable insights from large volumes of unstructured text dataâ€”a capability crucial in today's data-rich environment.

## The Role of Large Language Models in Text Classification and Extraction

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** like GPT-3 and GPT-4 have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. These models, trained on vast amounts of text data, offer several advantages over traditional machine learning approaches:

1. **Flexibility**: Applicable to a wide range of tasks without task-specific training.
2. **Context Understanding**: Capture nuanced context and semantics in text, leading to more accurate results.
3. **Few-shot Learning**: Perform well on new tasks with just a few examples, reducing the need for large labeled datasets.
4. **Multilingual Capabilities**: Trained on multilingual data, allowing tasks across multiple languages.

However, LLMs also present challenges, such as the need for careful prompt engineering, potential biases in training data, and the computational resources required. Their responses can sometimes be inconsistent or contain hallucinations, necessitating careful validation and error handling.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

Before we start, ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/). For those new to Rust, consider reviewing the [official Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) for an introduction to the language.

### Creating a New Rust Project

```bash
cargo new text_classifier_extractor
cd text_classifier_extractor
```

### Adding Dependencies

Update your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[package]
name = "text_classifier_extractor"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
rig-core = "0.0.6"
tokio = { version = "1.34.0", features = ["full"] }
anyhow = "1.0.75"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

Explanation of dependencies:

- **rig-core**: The main Rig library for building LLM applications.
- **tokio**: An asynchronous runtime for Rust.
- **anyhow**: For flexible error handling.
- **serde** and **serde_json**: For JSON serialization and deserialization.

### Managing API Keys Securely

Ensure you have an OpenAI API key. Instead of hardcoding it or setting it directly in the environment, use a secure method to manage secrets.

#### Using Environment Variables Securely

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive data:

```
# .gitignore
.env
```

Use the `dotenv` crate to load environment variables securely. Update your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
dotenv = "0.15.0"
```

In your `main.rs`, include:

```rust
dotenv::dotenv().ok();
```

This ensures your API key is loaded securely at runtime without exposing it in your codebase.

### Security Best Practices

- **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets**: Never hardcode API keys or secrets in your code.
- **Use Environment Variables**: Manage secrets via environment variables or a secrets management system.
- **Secure Storage**: For production, consider using secure key management services like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
- **Access Control**: Limit permissions for API keys to only necessary scopes.

With our environment securely set up, we're ready to start building our system.

## Building a Text Classification System with Rig

Let's implement a simple sentiment analysis classifier using Rig. We'll create a system that classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral.

### Defining Data Structures

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use rig::providers::openai;
use rig::extractor::Extractor;
use anyhow::Result;

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
enum Sentiment {
    Positive,
    Negative,
    Neutral,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct SentimentClassification {
    sentiment: Sentiment,
    confidence: f32,
}
```

### Implementing the Sentiment Classifier

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    dotenv::dotenv().ok(); // Load environment variables securely
    let openai_client = openai::Client::from_env()?;
    
    let sentiment_classifier = openai_client
        .extractor::<SentimentClassification>("gpt-3.5-turbo")
        .preamble("You are a sentiment analysis AI. Classify the sentiment of the given text.")
        .build();

    let text = "I absolutely loved the new restaurant. The food was amazing!";
    let result = sentiment_classifier.extract(text).await?;

    println!("Text: {}", text);
    println!("Sentiment: {:?}", result.sentiment);
    println!("Confidence: {:.2}", result.confidence);

    Ok(())
}
```

This code creates a sentiment classifier using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. The `Extractor` is configured with a preamble instructing the model to perform sentiment analysis. When we call `extract` with our input text, the model classifies the sentiment and returns a `SentimentClassification` struct.

### Enhancing Accuracy with Prompt Engineering

To improve accuracy, provide examples in the preamble:

```rust
let sentiment_classifier = openai_client
    .extractor::<SentimentClassification>("gpt-3.5-turbo")
    .preamble("
        You are a sentiment analysis AI. Classify the sentiment of the given text.
        Examples:
        Text: 'This movie was terrible. I hated every minute of it.'
        Sentiment: Negative, Confidence: 0.9
        Text: 'The weather today is okay, nothing special.'
        Sentiment: Neutral, Confidence: 0.7
        Text: 'I'm so excited about my upcoming vacation!'
        Sentiment: Positive, Confidence: 0.95
    ")
    .build();
```

---

## Implementing Information Extraction with Rig

Next, we'll create a named entity recognizer that identifies people, organizations, and locations in text.

### Defining Data Structures

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
enum EntityType {
    Person,
    Organization,
    Location,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Entity {
    text: String,
    entity_type: EntityType,
    start: usize,
    end: usize,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct ExtractedEntities {
    entities: Vec<Entity>,
}
```

### Implementing the Named Entity Recognizer

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    dotenv::dotenv().ok();
    let openai_client = openai::Client::from_env()?;
    
    let ner_extractor = openai_client
        .extractor::<ExtractedEntities>("gpt-3.5-turbo")
        .preamble("
            You are a named entity recognition AI. Identify and extract people, organizations, and locations from the given text.
            Provide the start and end indices for each entity.
        ")
        .build();

    let text = "Apple Inc., based in Cupertino, was founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.";
    let result = ner_extractor.extract(text).await?;

    println!("Text: {}", text);
    for entity in result.entities {
        println!(
            "Entity: {:?}, Type: {:?}, Range: {}:{}",
            entity.text, entity.entity_type, entity.start, entity.end
        );
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

This code uses the same `Extractor` abstraction to identify entities in the input text, returning a list of `Entity` structs.

---

## Combining Classification and Extraction

Let's combine both tasks into a unified system that performs sentiment analysis and named entity recognition on a given text.

### Defining the Combined Data Structure

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct TextAnalysis {
    sentiment: SentimentClassification,
    entities: Vec<Entity>,
}
```

### Implementing the Text Analyzer

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    dotenv::dotenv().ok();
    let openai_client = openai::Client::from_env()?;
    
    let text_analyzer = openai_client
        .extractor::<TextAnalysis>("gpt-3.5-turbo")
        .preamble("
            You are a text analysis AI. For the given text:
            1. Classify the overall sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) with a confidence score.
            2. Identify and extract named entities (Person, Organization, Location) with their start and end indices.
        ")
        .build();

    let text = "I had a great time visiting Google's headquarters in Mountain View. Sundar Pichai's leadership has been impressive.";
    let result = text_analyzer.extract(text).await?;

    println!("Text: {}", text);
    println!("Sentiment: {:?} (Confidence: {:.2})", result.sentiment.sentiment, result.sentiment.confidence);
    println!("Entities:");
    for entity in result.entities {
        println!(
            "- {:?}: {} ({}:{})",
            entity.entity_type, entity.text, entity.start, entity.end
        );
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

By combining tasks, we can process text more efficiently, especially when dealing with larger datasets.

## Advanced Techniques and Optimizations

As you build more complex systems with Rig, consider these advanced techniques:

1. **Fine-tuning**: For domain-specific tasks, fine-tuning an LLM on your data can significantly improve performance. Rig supports working with fine-tuned models.

2. **Prompt Engineering**: Experiment with different prompts. Include examples and clear instructions to guide the model's output.

3. **Batching**: When processing multiple texts, use Rig's batching capabilities to reduce API calls and improve throughput.

4. **Caching**: Implement a caching layer (e.g., using Redis) to store results for frequently analyzed texts, reducing API usage and improving response times.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to deal with API rate limits, network issues, and unexpected model outputs.

6. **Validation**: Add validation steps to ensure the model's output matches your expected format and constraints.

## Practical Example: Building a News Article Analyzer

Let's build a news article analyzer that classifies the article's topic, extracts key information, and performs sentiment analysis.

### Defining Data Structures

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
enum Topic {
    Politics,
    Technology,
    Sports,
    Entertainment,
    Other(String),
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct NewsArticleAnalysis {
    topic: Topic,
    sentiment: SentimentClassification,
    entities: Vec<Entity>,
    key_points: Vec<String>,
}
```

### Implementing the News Analyzer

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    dotenv::dotenv().ok();
    let openai_client = openai::Client::from_env()?;
    
    let news_analyzer = openai_client
        .extractor::<NewsArticleAnalysis>("gpt-4")
        .preamble("
            You are a news article analysis AI. For the given news article:
            1. Classify the main topic (Politics, Technology, Sports, Entertainment, or Other).
            2. Analyze the overall sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) with a confidence score.
            3. Identify and extract named entities (Person, Organization, Location) with their start and end indices.
            4. Extract 3-5 key points from the article.
        ")
        .build();

    let article = "/* Article text here */";
    
    let result = news_analyzer.extract(article).await?;

    println!("Article Analysis:");
    println!("Topic: {:?}", result.topic);
    println!("Sentiment: {:?} (Confidence: {:.2})", result.sentiment.sentiment, result.sentiment.confidence);
    println!("\nEntities:");
    for entity in &result.entities {
        println!(
            "- {:?}: {} ({}:{})",
            entity.entity_type, entity.text, entity.start, entity.end
        );
    }
    println!("\nKey Points:");
    for (i, point) in result.key_points.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("{}. {}", i + 1, point);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

Replace `/* Article text here */` with the actual article content.

#### Expected Output

```plaintext
