<div className="section-title">How to Contribute?</div>

Rig is an open-source project and we welcome contributions from the community. 
Whether you're a developer, designer, or writer, there are many ways to contribute to the project. 
The section below outlines the different areas where your help is most needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development
### Model Provider Integrations
Rig aims to support a wide range of language models from different providers.
If your favorite model provide is not supported, consider adding support for it in Rig and making a pull request for it!

Important information about model provider integrations:
- Each model provider integration is contained in its own module under [`rig-core/src/providers`](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig/tree/main/rig-core/src/providers).
- If the provider has an OpenAI compatible API, there is no need to write a new provider module since Rig already supports OpenAI. 
Instead, you can simply add documentation indicating how you can use the existing [`openai`](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig/blob/main/rig-core/src/providers/openai.rs) integration to use the new provider.
- ‚ùóModel provider integrations should not require new dependencies that are not already included in the project. 
If you need to add a new dependency, please open an issue for the integration to discuss it first.
- Make sure to follow the repository's [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Vector Store Integrations
Rig aims to support a wide range of vector stores for storing and retrieving embeddings. 
If your favorite vector store is not supported, consider adding support for it in Rig and making a pull request for it!

Important information about vector store integrations:
- Each vector store integration is contained in its own crate located in the root of the repository. 
The naming convention for vector store crates is `rig-<store_name>` (e.g. [`rig-mongodb`](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig/tree/main/rig-mongodb)). 
This is because vector store integrations often require many additional dependencies that are not needed otherwise.
- Consider adding an integration test for the integration! You can base yourself off of the existing vector store integration tests like this one for [Qdrant](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig/blob/main/rig-qdrant/tests/integration_tests.rs).
- Make sure to follow the repository's [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
